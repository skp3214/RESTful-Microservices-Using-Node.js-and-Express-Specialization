# KeepNote MySQL Queries

## Context

Keep Note is a website that helps users capture their minds and allows them to add notes and lists. It also allows adding a reminder to make sure that the user never misses a thing. It is possible to add labels to notes to quickly organize and get on with it.  ​

Keep Note application allows only the registered users to add notes and access them. To persist user details and notes information, it must be stored in a database that should be highly secure and reliable. ​

Due to its growing popularity, the number of users accessing the application has increased multifold. For a seamless user experience, choosing the right database which performs well and provides data faster is the need of the hour. ​

MySQL database server is open-source database software that is faster, secured,  reliable and cheaper because of its unique storage engine architecture. ​

The backend development team is now responsible for persisting the application data in the MySQL database which ensures durability. 

## Problem Statement

Keep Note application is used to​

- Take notes​
- Add notes to labels/categories​
- Set reminders for a note.​

As the first step in creating the application, create the necessary DB schema in MySQL database including tables, relationships and add sample data to each table using SQL queries. ​

### Task: Write SQL queries 

- Create the tables for Note, Category, Reminder, User, UserNote, NoteReminder and NoteCategory.
- User table fields: user_id, user_name, user_added_date, user_password, user_mobile
- Note table fields: note_id, note_title, note_content, note_status, note_creation_date
- Category table fields : category_id, category_name, category_descr, category_creation_date, category_creator
- Reminder table fields : reminder_id, reminder_name, reminder_descr, reminder_type, reminder_creation_date, reminder_creator
- NoteCategory table fields : notecategory_id, note_id, category_id
- Notereminder table fields : notereminder_id, note_id, reminder_id
- Usernote table fields : usernote_id, user_id, note_id
- Insert the rows into the created tables (Note, Category, Reminder, User, UserNote, NoteReminder and NoteCategory).
- Fetch the row from User table based on Id and Password.
- Fetch all the rows from Note table based on the field note_creation_date.
- Fetch all the Categories created after the particular Date.
- Fetch all the Note ID from UserNote table for a given User.
- Write Update query to modify particular Note for the given note Id.
- Fetch all the Notes from the Note table by a particular User.
- Fetch all the Notes from the Note table for a particular Category.
- Fetch all the reminder details for a given note id.
- Fetch the reminder details for a given reminder id.
- Write a query to create a new Note from particular User (Use Note and UserNote tables - insert statement).
- Write a query to create a new Note from particular User to particular Category(Use Note and NoteCategory tables - insert statement)
- Write a query to set a reminder for a particular note (Use Reminder and NoteReminder tables - insert statement)
- Write a query to delete particular Note added by a User(Note and UserNote tables - delete statement)
- Write a query to delete particular Note from particular Category(Note and NoteCategory tables - delete statement)
